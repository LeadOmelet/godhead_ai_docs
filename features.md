# Features
Alexstraza is a rough canvas that is not held back by domain restrictions. This means Alexstraza can be whatever is needed of her to be.

Initial features that you may wish to utilize is reminder setting and adding items to lists and collections.

As you look through the documentation, it is important to note that you do not have to follow any of the examples word for word. Conversational interfaces are meant to be fluid. However, if problems occurr with your particular phrasing then you can refer to the command examples provided. Though, please let us know of your failed attempt so we can continuously improve Alexstraza.
